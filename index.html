        What is this?
      </h2>
      <p>
        2020 has been a year none of us could have imagined (or maybe your
        imagination is a little wilder than mine...). While folks in the US
        traditionally spend Thanksgiving Day with their family, or adopted
        family, many of us will be spending the day by ourselves or in much
        smaller circles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Personally, I'm quarantining at my sublet in Bed Study after traveling
        back from Germany to visit my family, so I'm running this project while
        baking a sweet potato pie and drinking my way through a rotation of Rob
        Roy's (Scotch Manhattan), Negronis, and Scotch and Sodas.
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked my friends to submit something... anything, that comes to their
        mind when they think of <b>"2020"</b>. This is what they sent me. It's a
        snapshot of our minds on this day - new parents, pets, gardening, junk
        yards, gratitude, loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >I'll be updating the site throughout the day as submissions come in,
          as I interview people, as things happen. Text me, email me, DM me on
          Twitter, or contact me some other way if you'd like to send me
          something. I'm taking contributions until midnight in your favorite
          time zone!</b

        I loved to draw from an early age, but this was the first painted piece
        I produced. It has a crab, a fish, and seaweed in an arrangement of a
        tropical freshwater scene. I believe I copied it from a book and wasn‚Äôt
        too hot on colour mixing, though poster paint is not the most forgiving
        medium. I suspect I was around 8-10 when I made this, evidenced by the
        ability to write my name in capital letters in a controlled form.
      </p>

      <p>
        I painted this at South Failsworth County Primary School, where I learnt
        I was neither catholic nor religious. Mr. Brice, the headteacher, was
        the first southerner I ever met. He had a distressing habit of
        half-chewing his food then pulling it back out of his mouth, with
        *stuff* on it, but I still held him in regard. The first vandalism I
        remember seeing was a spray-painted penis on the back of the school with
        ‚Äòbrice pudding‚Äô beside it. Mr. Brice was not a slim man.

        While in home quarantine not just under city mandate but also in the
        fits of being a symptomatic coronavirus patient, I passed the feverish
        time noodling on guitar. I barely even remember writing it but
        thankfully recorded the ska chords and the bassline of Skarona Virus and
        shared it with my brother Paul, bandmate of InRod Paul, and friend Nikki
        using the collaborative recording tool SoundTrap. Over the course of a
        week or two we had the full song as it stands despite never spending
        time in the same room.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sat dormant on my computer for a few months but when Trump caught the
        virus it just seemed like we had to send it out into the world. The band
        name Curbside Happy Hour is a nod to the early days of taking drinks to
        go from the few bars that were able to open up early and New Yorkers
        were sitting on curbs pretending to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù time.

        This Thanksgiving I find myself doing what I did most of 2020, walking
        around and taking photos. When Sam reached out I had just happen to take
        this photo of a junk yard deep in Greenpoint, filled with trucks and
        shipping containers containing unknown...shit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like 2020 itself, a phenomenal carnival of unpredictable shit. At
        first its hard to find the beauty in a junkyard. There‚Äôs not much to
        look at. I couldn‚Äôt find any beauty in 2020. I got dumped, my dog died,
        my best friend moved away, Donald Trump is doing Donald Trump shit and
        oh yeah that whole pandemic thing is still ravaging the world. But
        within this chaotic orgy of hell, I learned a lot about myself. I
        learned a lot about the world too, and I came to see the beauty in it
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm thankful today (even though I don‚Äôt like thanksgiving because it‚Äôs a
        way to whitewash a genocide) for 2020. I have a feeling 2021 may not be
        so different, but after all this I‚Äôm ready to see what else life can
        throw our way.

        Well... In February we just snuck in a Japan trip before Covid hit,
        which was probably the most memorable holiday of my life! Wanted to go
        there since I was a kid. But from March up until Dylan was born in
        August the whole period is a blur. Nothing happened. The country has
        been in one type of lockdown or another, we can't go anywhere and I've
        worked from home. So it's almost like a 'lost' year because every day
        blurred into the next during that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a certain simplistic peace to it, I did alot more exercise and
        not having a morning commute was quite wonderful. And my bank balance
        enjoyed not having to pay UK train ticket prices! But it also seems
        quite empty now, devoid of anything memorable or exciting. Then Dylan
        arrived in August and it has been a whirlwind of figuring out how to be
        a parent! Luckily 5 months off work at full pay (it's good to work for a
        trade union!) for me means I get to be involved in this early part of
        her life in a way most Dads can't. So this is obviously going to be an
        incredibly memorable time of my life. I think looking back at 2020 in
        like 10 years time it will probably end up being one of the most
        significant years of my life for all kinds of reasons, despite me not
        really remembering what happened between March and August!

        2020 has been quite the year for many of us. It drastically changed the
        world I knew in a way that I never expected. Before the pandemic went
        into full swing, I was living in upstate New York for a few months.
        During this time, I was commuting to work in FiDi, which really took a
        huge toll on my mental health and general happiness. In March, I finally
        was able to move back to Brooklyn and into my dream apartment. I had my
        eye on this building for quite some time and waited a year for something
        to become available. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that 6 days after I moved into
        my sweet new Brooklyn pad that we would be in a pandemic lockdown. The
        city was starting to feel like a ghost town. It definitely was not what
        I remember leaving behind. I couldn‚Äôt see my friends, people were dying
        at alarming rates, and no one really knew how to fight the virus. I was
        scared. I was depressed. I was scared for the world as I knew it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then several months later, the killing of George Floyd sparked national
        outrage. Americans took to the streets and social media to express their
        anger and frustration with the deep rooted oppression of black people in
        this country. During this time I learned, unfortunately, that a lot of
        people that I considered ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were closet racists. They held on to
        some deep rooted prejudice against people of color that didn‚Äôt really
        surface until social media forced everyone to face systematic racism
        head on. This changed the world I knew since I had to cut ties with many
        friends that revealed through their actions and ignorant statements,
        that they only saw me as a ‚Äútoken" to validate that they arguably were
        not racist.
      </p>
      <p>
        U.S. Elections happened during the pandemic as well. Many people believe
        that this has been the most polarizing election in U.S.history. I have
        to disagree with that. I think that America is changing and it is no
        longer acceptable to be racist, misogynistic, ignorant, homo/trans
        phobic, etc. To think that it was even acceptable to be those things in
        the first place is deeply upsetting. More people are being held
        accountable for their beliefs which is a good thing in my opinion. We
        should all be holding the people in our lives accountable, even if it
        means having to end some relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        As many of you may or not may not know, I am a 90‚Äôs Alternative music
        buff. No, really. I am seriously stuck in the 90‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt think I
        will ever escape. In 1995, a band called Collective Soul released a song
        called ‚ÄôThe World I Know‚Äô. I found myself listening and resonating with
        this song a lot during the pandemic since the world I knew had
        drastically changed. Music is a safe healing space for me so I recorded
        a cover of this song when I was wallowing in the doldrums. The guitar,
        drums, and the very questionable vocals, were recorded by yours truly.
        Kyle, the AI provided by Apple, is ripping it up on drums. Imagine
        having a drum set in a Brooklyn Studio apartment? I can‚Äôt imagine it
        either which is why I use AI. =P
      </p>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world I know and I‚Äôm starting to
        think that I may never get that back.

        My backyard kept me sane this quarantine. I'm really grateful for having
        a garden to play in each morning and every day after work. Last year I
        did my first gardening in the ground experiments (I used to garden in
        pots everywhere else I lived). My big disappointment was the zuchinni. I
        only got two tiny zuchs and lots of powdery mildew. But this year, I had
        the time to learn and tend to the plants more. The result was we needed
        to learn lots of recipes with zuchini and get comfortable with a
        spiralizer:) They came out enormous! Banana for scale.

        2020‚Äôs honestly been a lot of... self reflection, introspection, blah
        blah. As cheesy and annoyingly millennial that sounds, it‚Äôs really true.
        That meme that‚Äôs floating around about how this year has been about
        learning to be grateful for what I have instead of yearning for what I
        want basically sums it up for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Particularly, I‚Äôve fallen in love with New York after living here since
        2014. (I know. I know.) Kudos to how a city with this many people that
        normally are super disconnected from each other has really made me feel
        less alone somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here‚Äôs to 2021 being a much much much much better f*cking year for us
        all.

        It usually happens around 4-5pm on The Festive Day [insert your own
        here], like an hour or so after you‚Äôve all eaten, and after the strong
        booze has come out, and then probably the backup strong booze, and just
        as it‚Äôs starting to go dark outside in that soft deep blue way that you
        only really get in the early days of winter. You‚Äôll be taking a gross
        black bag of assorted holiday rubbish out to the big bins - potato
        scrapings and congealed gravy and torn-up paper hats and wine corks and
        gift wrap and busted glass and the spent fuses of pulled crackers - and
        you‚Äôll close the kitchen door behind you and step out into that soft
        blue dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evening chill hits your flushed cheeks with a real slap, and it‚Äôs
        almost shockingly still and quiet as you crunch down the driveway of a
        house you probably don‚Äôt live in (perhaps you used to, once, but so many
        years ago now that it doesn‚Äôt really feel a part of you in the same way
        any more). You look back at the house over your shoulder, and the
        windows are just a foggy orange glow so you can‚Äôt really see in, but you
        can hear the muffled sounds of some stupid party game or cheesy movie,
        or a tipsy argument, or Mariah Carey, or whatever. Someone rattling
        plates in the kitchen and doing Very Bad Singing, that kind of thing.
        Someone yelling that the dog ate all the leftover cranberry sauce and
        threw up.

        Maybe there‚Äôs a glitter of frost on the gate. Maybe a car door slams a
        couple of streets over. Maybe the first couple of stars are just
        beginning to peek out, if we‚Äôre really writing this scene properly. And
        we are, so you set down the bin bag and just stand there gazing up at
        them for a second, feeling the bite of cold through the soles of
        whoever‚Äôs shoes you slipped on to do the job, watching your freezing
        breath curl upwards and disappear, and in your head you sort of zoom out
        of your yard and your street and your city, and you think about being an
        ant-sized hitchhiker on a random giant rock hurtling through empty
        space, and how most of the very few alive people that you truly know -
        or who truly know you - are stuffed into that overheated brick box
        behind you right at this second, all sweating in itchy new jumpers and
        doing poorly concealed turkey farts, half-assing the assembly of some
        nephew‚Äôs Lego pirate ship or trying to mime the title of a famous book
        they haven‚Äôt read and never will, just being extremely themselves and
        extremely annoying and extremely <b>there</b>, and you‚Äôve all been apart
        for so long and done so much and now here you all are again, and it‚Äôs
        the same, and it‚Äôs different, and it won‚Äôt last forever, it can‚Äôt, but
        you‚Äôre exactly where you should be <b>right now</b> for once in your
        entire life, and it‚Äôs sort of a good and sad feeling all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you exhale one long last misty breath up into that soft blue dark,
        which seems deeper now (how long have you been out here? A minute? An
        hour?), watch it tumble away and vanish. And then you dump the trash and
        go back in, because what else are you gonna do. What else are you gonna
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I‚Äôm thinking about my US friends and how a lot of them would be
        having their own little versions of this today, on Thanksgiving, except
        that it‚Äôs really going to hit different for a lot of people this year,
        if it hits at all, and...I guess I‚Äôm just saying let‚Äôs make 2021 a
        really good one if we can. Lots of love.
